Go to the rooms tab to select a room and begin chatting. Type in a message, click 'submit' or click enter to send a message. <br />
You can optionally specify a name for yourself, but it will not stay if you leave. <br />
Everyone who is on this website can chat freely and anonymously.<br /><br />

Click 'update' to update the chats, they will NOT update by themselves.<br /><br />


Basic rules:
<ul>
<li>You will only be able to see six messages at a time in any given chatroom, so make your message count!</li>
<li>Your messages are capped at 50 characters, and names are capped at 20.</li>
<li>Assholes are capped immediately.</li>
<li>Images can be posted in TV and Animation.</li>
</ul>

This was written as a small project by Keller in Mr. Wrencher's Web Technologies class; it uses mostly PHP, and CSS for styling. Source is currently unavailable, but I will host it if someone asks. <br />
